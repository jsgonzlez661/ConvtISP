      Program created to convert images to grayscale or black-and-white.
      Resolution of 300 dpi <br> <br>
      Compatible Formats:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>.jpeg .jpg</strong>: JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is an 
          algorithm designed to compress images with 24-bit depth 
          grayscale.It is usually called JPG due to the extension 
          it has in operating systems that only accept three letters 
          of extension.   </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>.png</strong>: Portable Network Graphics is a graphical format based 
          on a lossless compression algorithm for non-patent bitmaps. 
          This format was developed largely to address the deficiencies 
          of the GIF format and allows images with greater depth of contrast 
          and other important data to be stored.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>.tiff</strong>: TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a computer file
           format for storing bitmap images. It is prevalent in the graphic 
           industry and in professional photography because of its versatility 
           and non-destructive compression. </li>

    <h4>Python 3.x</h4>
    <p>
      Python is an interpreted programming language whose philosophy emphasizes
      a syntax that favors readable code. It is a multiparadigm programming
      language, as it supports object orientation, imperative programming and,
      to a lesser extent, functional programming.
      <br /> <br>
      Available in:
      <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="blank">https://www.python.org/</a>

    </p>
    <h4>Tkinter 8.6</h4>
    <p>
      Tkinter is a binding of the graphical library Tcl/Tk for the Python
      programming language. It is considered a standard for the graphical user
      interface for Python and is the one that comes by default with the
      installation for Microsoft Windows.
      <br> <br>
      To install on Linux run the following command on the terminal:
      <br>
      <em>sudo apt-get install python3-tk</em>    
    </p>
    <h4>Pillow o PIL 5.2</h4>
    <p>
      Python Imaging Library (abbreviated as PIL) (in newer versions known as Pillow) 
      is a free library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening,
      manipulating and saving many image formats.
      <br> <br>
      To install on Linux run the following command on the terminal:
      <br>
      <em>sudo apt-get install python3-pip</em>
      <br>
      <em>pip3 install Pillow</em>  
      <br><br>
