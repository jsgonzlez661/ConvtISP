NEW VERSION 0.0.2

## Compatible Formats

* __.jpeg .jpg__: JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is an algorithm designed to compress images with 24-bit depth grayscale. It is usually called JPG due to the extension it has in operating systems that only accept three letters of extension.

* __.png__: Portable Network Graphics is a graphical format based on a lossless compression algorithm for non-patent bitmaps. This format was developed largely to address the deficiencies of the GIF format and allows images with greater depth of contrast and other important data to be stored.

* __.tiff__: TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a computer file format for storing bitmap images. It is prevalent in the graphic industry and in professional photography because of its versatility and non-destructive compression.
